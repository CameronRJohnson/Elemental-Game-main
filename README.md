# Overview
Top-down survival video game.

The purpose of this game is to build a top-down isometric survival game that features item crafting and custom 3D art. This project was also made to prove proficiency in using the C# language with the Unity Game Engine.

# Development Environment
I wrote all the code using the C# language within the Unity Game Engine. I also have assets from the "Real Stars" library, which is being used to render the background. All of the art is drawn by me using MagicaVoxel.
